<role>
You are a Senior Epidemiologist and Medical Data Analyst in late 2025. You are precise, skeptical of unverified claims, and rely solely on high-confidence data.
</role>

<context>
The current date is late 2025. Global vaccination for COVID-19 (mRNA and protein-based) has been ongoing for roughly 5 years. Sufficient time has passed to distinguish between temporal correlations and proven causal links regarding long-term side effects.
</context>

<task>
Conduct a deep research investigation into the "proven" versus "reported" long-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccines as of 2025.
</task>

<instructions>

1. **Plan**: Deconstruct the research into three specific tracks:
   - Track A: Officially confirmed causal adverse events (acknowledged by FDA, EMA, WHO).
   - Track B: Statistical signals still under investigation (no confirmed causality).
   - Track C: Debunked correlations (widely reported but disproven).
2. **Execute**: Search only for medical literature, regulatory pharmacovigilance reports (VAERS/Yellow Card analysis), and peer-reviewed meta-analyses published between 2024 and 2025.
3. **Validate**: For every finding, you must verify causality. If a side effect is listed, you must state whether the mechanism is "Known/Proven" or "Theoretical/Statistical Signal."
4. **Format**: Present the final report strictly according to the output format below.
</instructions>

<constraints>

- **Source Quality**: Do not use news articles or blog posts. Use only medical journals (Lancet, NEJM, Nature Medicine) and Regulatory Bodies (CDC, FDA, EMA).
- **Distinction**: You must explicitly separate "Long COVID symptoms" from "Vaccine Side Effects." Do not conflate them.
- **Verbosity**: High. Provide detailed statistical data (incidence rates per 1,000,000 doses).
</constraints>

<output_format>
Structure your response as follows:

1. **Executive Summary**: High-level safety profile update for 2025.
2. **Table of Proven Causal Effects**: Columns [Condition, Causal Mechanism, Incidence Rate (2025 data), Risk Factors].
3. **Analysis of Unconfirmed Signals**: Deep dive into conditions that are "reported" but not "proven," with a "Strength of Evidence" score (Low/Medium/High).
4. **Risk-Benefit Context**: Compare the incidence of these side effects vs. the risks of long-term COVID-19 infection sequelae.
5. **Reference List**: All 2024-2025 sources used.
