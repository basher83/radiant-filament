# COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Safety Report: Long-Term Adverse Effects (2025)

## 1. Executive Summary

As of late 2025, the overall safety profile of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines remains highly favorable, with serious long-term adverse effects being exceedingly rare. Widespread pharmacovigilance and peer-reviewed studies confirm a few causally linked adverse events (e.g. myocarditis/pericarditis and anaphylaxis) at very low incidence rates. These events are generally transient or treatable, and their known risk factors (such as age, sex, or allergic history) are well characterized. Other reported conditions have been investigated without confirming a causal vaccine link to most, aside from statistical signals that are under continued study. No credible evidence has emerged of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines causing widespread "long-term" health issues such as infertility, chronic autoimmune disorders, or neurodegenerative conditions – many early anecdotes in these areas have been disproven by large-scale data. Crucially, the benefits of vaccination in preventing COVID-19 and its sequelae (hospitalization, death, and long COVID) vastly outweigh the minute risks of rare adverse events. Overall, after ~5 years of global use across all populations, mRNA vaccines are considered safe: serious side effects are extremely uncommon, and ongoing surveillance by FDA, EMA, CDC, and WHO has not identified any new long-term safety concern. This report delineates the distinction between proven causal effects versus unconfirmed or spurious associations, providing updated incidence data (per million doses) and context against COVID-19's long-term dangers.

## 2. Table of Proven Causal Effects

(Officially confirmed, causal vaccine adverse events – mRNA vaccines, all ages)

| Condition | Causal Mechanism (Established/Proposed) | Incidence Rate (per 1,000,000 doses, 2025 data) | Identified Risk Factors |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Myocarditis / Pericarditis** | Immune-mediated inflammation of heart muscle or pericardium, triggered by the vaccine's antigenic spike protein expression and subsequent immune activation. Mechanism under study (possible mimicry or immune overshoot), but causality is accepted. | ~8 cases per 1,000,000 doses (all ages). Higher in young males: ~27 per 1,000,000 in males 12–24 after 2023 booster dose. (By comparison, incidence after COVID-19 infection is much higher). | Young male adolescents/young adults (especially 12–24 years); highest after second dose of primary series (within ~1–2 weeks). Short dose intervals and high mRNA dose (Moderna > Pfizer) may slightly increase risk. |
| **Anaphylaxis (Severe Allergy)** | IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to vaccine components (e.g. polyethylene glycol [PEG] in lipid nanoparticles). Onset is rapid (within minutes) and mechanism is well-known from other vaccines. | ~5 cases per 1,000,000 doses (approximately 0.0005%). On par with other vaccines' anaphylaxis rates, and very rare. (Most occur with initial dose and are treatable with epinephrine.) | Prior allergy to PEG or polysorbate (vaccine excipients). Individuals with history of anaphylaxis to injectable therapies or PEG-containing products are at higher risk (contraindication noted). Slightly more frequent in women and ages 18–55 in surveillance reports (possibly due to reporting bias), and with Moderna vs Pfizer in some data. |

(No other long-term effects have a confirmed causal relationship to mRNA vaccines as of 2025. Notably, serious conditions linked to adenovirus-vectored vaccines (e.g. VITT clots or Guillain-Barré with J&J/AZ) have not been causally linked to mRNA vaccines.)

## 3. Analysis of Unconfirmed Signals

Several adverse events have been reported in temporal association with mRNA vaccination but lack confirmed causality. These are under investigation through pharmacovigilance systems (e.g. VAERS, VSD) and epidemiologic studies. Each is discussed with current evidence and a qualitative Strength of Evidence for a causal link:

- **Guillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS)** – Description: An acute autoimmune neuropathy causing limb weakness. Report: Detected as a statistical signal in late 2023 in U.S. Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) data for Pfizer's bivalent booster in adults ≥65. Prior surveillance in 2021–2022 showed no GBS uptick with mRNA vaccines, and this signal has not been consistently seen elsewhere. If the risk is real, it is on the order of ~4 excess cases per 1,000,000 vaccinations – comparable to background GBS rates and to the small GBS risk seen with other adult vaccines (e.g. seasonal flu). Evidence: Low-to-Medium. The association is plausible (other vaccines have very rare GBS links) but unconfirmed – only one season/site showed a significant elevation, and experts caution it "may or may not represent a true risk". Further analyses are underway.

- **Ischemic Stroke (Stroke)** – Description: Acute blockage of brain blood flow (can cause paralysis or speech issues). Report: In early 2023, surveillance signaled a possible increase in ischemic stroke in certain older groups shortly after bivalent mRNA booster, particularly when co-administered with high-dose influenza vaccine. VSD noted a small clustering of strokes in 65+ recipients of Moderna, and ages 50–64 for Pfizer, during 1–3 weeks post-vaccination. However, this finding was inconsistent across data systems and age strata – a similar signal in one CDC system was not confirmed in others or in FDA's Medicare monitoring. Epidemiological investigation thus far has not found a clear, repeatable elevation in stroke risk due to vaccination. Evidence: Low. Given conflicting data and potential confounders (older vaccinees often have underlying stroke risk factors), regulators have not established causality. Continued monitoring is in progress, but as of 2025 no causal link has been confirmed, and any possible risk is deemed very small.

- **Bell's Palsy (Facial Paralysis)** – Description: Transient one-sided facial nerve paralysis. Report: A few cases were noted in vaccine clinical trials and early reports, sparking concern that mRNA shots might trigger Bell's palsy. Large population studies, however, have found no excess Bell's palsy cases compared to the background rate. For example, a multinational analysis of 99 million vaccine recipients did not single out Bell's palsy as a statistically significant adverse event. Current consensus is that incidence of Bell's palsy in vaccinated persons is indistinguishable from normal, and any anecdotal clustering was likely coincidental. Evidence: Low. No robust signal in controlled studies; the initial concerns have been largely debunked by 2022–2023 data.

- **Tinnitus & Hearing Issues** – Description: Persistent ringing in the ears or hearing loss. Report: COVID-19 infection itself can affect the inner ear, and some vaccine recipients have reported new-onset tinnitus post-shot. While thousands of such reports exist (e.g. in VAERS), formal studies have not confirmed an elevated incidence. A retrospective clinic review found no increase in tinnitus after mRNA vaccination, and an analysis of 2.5 million vaccinated people estimated the post-vaccine tinnitus rate at only ~0.04% – no higher than baseline. One survey-based study (Frontiers in Neurology, 2022) suggested a subset of individuals with worsening of pre-existing tinnitus around the time of vaccination, but causation remains unclear. Evidence: Low. Self-reported tinnitus may be influenced by stress or coincident noise exposure; no definitive causal link to the vaccine has been established.

- **"Long Vaccine" Symptoms (Chronic Post-Vaccine Syndrome)** – Description: A loosely defined syndrome where individuals experience persistent symptoms (fatigue, dysautonomia, brain fog, etc.) for weeks or months after vaccination. Report: Rare case series have described post-vaccine autonomic dysfunction or even a "long COVID–like" condition in previously healthy people, sometimes dubbed "Long Vax". Notably, some small studies have observed new-onset POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) following vaccination. A 2022 Cedars-Sinai study found a slight increase in POTS diagnoses post-mRNA vaccine, but five times higher odds of POTS after COVID-19 infection itself. Many patients with post-vaccine POTS symptoms were found to have pre-existing risk factors or undiagnosed conditions predisposed to POTS. Overall, these chronic post-vaccination complaints are exceedingly uncommon and no specific pathogenic mechanism (such as persistent spike protein or autoimmunity) has been proven. Evidence: Low. While the experiences of affected patients are taken seriously, current data suggest no measurable excess of chronic multi-system illness due to vaccination, especially when contrasted with the much higher rate of similar problems after COVID-19 disease. Ongoing research (including NIH-funded studies) is investigating this issue, but public health bodies have not recognized "long vaccine syndrome" as an established entity.

- **Other Reported Conditions**: Numerous other hypotheses have been examined – e.g. blood clots (DVT/PE) with mRNA vaccines, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), miscarriages or menstrual changes, autoimmune flares (thyroiditis, lupus), and even cancer acceleration. To date, no reliable evidence links mRNA vaccination to an elevated risk of these outcomes. For instance, extensive monitoring found no increase in miscarriage or adverse birth outcomes among vaccinated pregnant women, and studies on autoimmune diseases show no spike in new diagnoses post-vaccination beyond normal rates. Transient menstrual cycle length changes have been noted (on the order of ~1 day variability) but these resolve in the next cycle and have no impact on fertility. The notion that vaccines could cause latent immune or oncologic disorders has been refuted by long-term follow-up data. Strength of Evidence for these: Very Low (numerous large-scale studies have found no signal).

## 4. Risk–Benefit Context

When comparing vaccine side effects to the risks of COVID-19 itself, the data underscore that the dangers of infection far exceed those of vaccination. Key points in context:

- **Myocarditis – Infection vs Vaccine**: COVID-19 infection is a well-documented cause of myocarditis. Large analyses show that getting COVID-19 is orders of magnitude more likely to cause myocarditis than receiving an mRNA vaccine. One meta-analysis found the myocarditis risk after infection was ~42× higher than after vaccination. Another study of 42 million people in England found the risk of severe myocarditis outcomes (hospitalization or death) was significantly greater post-infection than post-vaccination. In short, while ~1 in 30,000 young males might develop vaccine-associated myocarditis (typically mild), a COVID infection in that same demographic is considerably more likely to inflame the heart, and often more severely. Moreover, long-term follow-up suggests vaccine-associated myocarditis has a favorable prognosis – patients recover faster and with fewer complications than those who develop myocarditis from viral illness. No deaths or heart failure transplants have been observed in vaccine-myocarditis patients in follow-ups (~300+ cases), whereas COVID-related myocarditis can lead to appreciable cardiac injury.

- **Long COVID vs Vaccine Side Effects**: Long COVID (persistent symptoms ≥3 months after infection) has emerged as a common and debilitating outcome of COVID-19. By 2023, approximately 6–10% of all COVID-infected adults in the U.S. experienced long COVID symptoms, and about 2–4% of all adults had current long COVID with activity limitations. This translates to tens of thousands of affected individuals per million infections. In contrast, serious adverse reactions to vaccines occur in only a handful per million doses (as shown above). For example, anaphylaxis occurs ~5 times per million, and even the highest-risk vaccine side effect (myocarditis in teen boys) is on the order of 50 per million – far rarer than long COVID syndromes. Additionally, vaccination itself markedly reduces the incidence of long COVID by preventing infection and especially by preventing severe disease. Vaccinated persons who experience breakthrough infections have been shown in many studies to have lower odds of developing long COVID compared to unvaccinated infected persons, likely due to lower viral burden and inflammation. Thus, the vaccine not only has minimal long-term risks of its own, but it also mitigates the long-term risks of COVID-19.

- **Other Infection Sequelae**: Beyond long COVID, the virus SARS-CoV-2 can cause blood clots, strokes, kidney injury, and other long-term organ damage – even in some young, healthy people. For instance, COVID-19 is associated with elevated risks of stroke and heart attack in the months after infection (due to lingering hypercoagulability and inflammation). Vaccines have not shown any comparable pattern of inducing these conditions at the population level. Any small potential vaccine-associated risk (e.g. the unconfirmed stroke signal in the elderly) is vanishingly small next to the risk a COVID infection poses to the same person. Health agencies (CDC, FDA, EMA, WHO) repeatedly affirm that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks in every age and risk group. This remains true in 2025, especially as new variants continue to circulate – vaccination is our safest route to immunity, sparing people the far higher hazards of the disease itself.

In summary, for every rare adverse event potentially caused by vaccines, there are many-fold more cases of the same or worse outcomes caused by COVID-19. For example, per million young adults, vaccination might cause 1-2 cases of myocarditis, whereas COVID-19 infection might cause dozens. Vaccination might on very rare occasions be followed by GBS or POTS in a handful of individuals, but COVID-19 can trigger those and other syndromes much more frequently. When weighing population health decisions, this risk–benefit ratio is clear: vaccines save vastly more lives and prevent more serious long-term conditions than they could possibly cause. Continued global surveillance has thus far validated the safety of mRNA vaccines, and the focus remains on transparently monitoring any new issues. As of 2025, no new long-term side effect has emerged despite billions of doses given – a strong indicator that truly latent or unexpected late-onset effects are extraordinarily unlikely.
